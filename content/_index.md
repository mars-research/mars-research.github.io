# Mars Research Group

Mars Research is a systems research group at the [University of
Utah](https://www.utah.edu). Primarily we work in the areas of operating
systems and security.

Historically, we are always working on at least one clean slate operating
system (in the past we did [RedLeaf](./redleaf), a clean slate operating system
in Rust), right now we work on [Atmostphere](./atmo), a clean-slate
fully-verified operating system. 

We are a small team (it feels like a small startup), but we push out some
amazing things (clean slate kernels!)

## Active Projects 

- Atmostphere verified operating system develooped in Rust and Verus:
  [atmo](./atmo)

- Formally verified drivers for the Linux kernel [VELD](./veld)

- Hardware support for low-overhead, fine grained isolation [ipc](./ipc)

- Retrofitting isolation in the Linux kernel:
  [kernel-isolation](./kernel-isolation)

- Hash table designed to work at the speed of DRAM: [DRAMHiT](./dramhit)

- Impact of Rust on the Linux kernel: [rfl](./rfl)

## Past Projects 

- Redleaf operating system: [redleaf](./redleaf)

- KSplit framework for decomposing the Linux kernel [ksplit](./ksplit)

- Lightweight VMFUNC Domains [LVDs](./lvds)

- Lightweight eXecution Domains [LXDs](./lxds)
