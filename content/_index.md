Mars Research is a systems research group at the [University of
Utah](https://www.utah.edu). Primarily we are interested in a broad range of
problems at the very core of the systems stack related to the security,
reliability, and performance of **operating systems**. 


Our work explores the challenges related to the design and implementation of
operating systems as well as a range of issues on the intersection of systems
with architecture, programming languages, security, and formal methods.

Historically, we are always working on at least one clean-slate operating
system. Right now its:

- [Atmostphere](./atmo), a clean-slate fully-verified operating system

Notable past projects are [RedLeaf](./redleaf), a clean slate operating system
that uses Rust safety for isolation, and [KSplit](./ksplit), a static analysis
framework and lightweight runtime for automatic isolation of device drivers in
the Linux kernel. 

We also built [DRAMHiT](./dramhit) -- the fastest ever hash table.  

We're **always looking for motivated students interested in operating systems**
at all levels from undergraduate to PhD. If you have relevant skills (take a
look at our repos to see what we normally do) send me an email.

## Active Projects 

- Atmostphere verified operating system develooped in Rust and Verus:
  [atmo](./atmo)

- Formally verified drivers for the Linux kernel [VELD](./veld)

- Hardware support for low-overhead, fine grained isolation [ipc](./ipc)

- Retrofitting isolation in the Linux kernel:
  [kernel-isolation](./kernel-isolation)

- Hash table designed to work at the speed of DRAM: [DRAMHiT](./dramhit)

- Impact of Rust on the Linux kernel: [rfl](./rfl)

## Past Projects 

- Redleaf operating system: [redleaf](./redleaf)

- KSplit framework for decomposing the Linux kernel [ksplit](./ksplit)

- Lightweight VMFUNC Domains [LVDs](./lvds)

- Lightweight eXecution Domains [LXDs](./lxds)
